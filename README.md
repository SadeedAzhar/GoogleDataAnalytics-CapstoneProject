# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

This repository contains my capstone project completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** on Coursera. The project applies the full data analysis process—Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act—using real-world data to derive business insights and inform decision-making.

##  Project Overview

The analysis is based on a fictional dataset provided by Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The goal of this project is to help the marketing team design strategies that convert casual riders into annual members.

##  Problem Statement

**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**  
By exploring usage trends and customer behaviors, this project aims to provide actionable recommendations to increase user retention and membership conversion.

##  Tools & Techniques Used

**Excel** for initial data cleaning
**R** (Tidyverse, ggplot2) for data wrangling and visualization
**SQL** for querying structured datasets
**Tableau** for creating interactive dashboards

## Key Findings

Casual riders are more active on weekends, while annual members ride more during weekdays
Annual members have shorter average ride durations, suggesting more frequent, utilitarian usage
Popular ride types and stations vary significantly between the two user segments

## Recommendations

Offer weekend membership promotions targeted at casual riders
Highlight convenience and cost savings of annual plans in marketing materials
Place membership offers at high-traffic casual rider stations
